[Software Engineering Grad Lacks The Skills That Startup Needs](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-institute/ieee-member-news/software-engineering-grads-lack-the-skills-startups-need)

The article talks about how the majority of universities today are teaching students the skills that cater to the needs of large tech companies such as software processes, software analysis, project management, and software management. However, with startup companies, they need their engineers to have an in depth understanding of the software ecosystem and its tools. The article mentions how there are certain skill sets that a student is expected to understand (how cloud computing platforms work, etc) but alot of students dont understand since it is not part of their curriculum. The article talks about wanting a shift in the curriculum to better prepare students for a job in a tech startup too. 


I find this article interesting because I think students need to be prepared for both a job in a startup or a job in a large tech company. It isnt always the case that students can land a job in a large tech company fresh out of college, but without having these skills that startups are looking for, they are also not able to land a job in a startup company. 


Good work !!
