[New Grocery Tech Startup](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/ex-amazon-google-managers-reveal-new-grocery-tech-startup-powered-smart-shopping-cart/)

The article talks about how an ex Amazon and Google employee has been developing a grocery cart that would enable a check-out less shopping experience. Inspired by the Amazon Go store in Seattle, they have developed a grocery cart that has an on cart screen that would give directions to products in the grocery store. They have placed sensors and cameras in the cart that would allow detection if an item has been placed or removed from the cart. After a customer finishes shopping all they need to do is swipe their card and they can leave. 

I find this article interesting because its amazing how technology has developed so much that a day to day activity such as grocery shopping is made to be so easy that people no longer need to wait in line to pay all they need to do is walk in and walk out.
